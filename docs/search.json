    "text": "As consultant statisticians, we are often approached by people who have already done some preliminary data analysis and who are looking to move onto something more complex. Often, they have done some methodology research. As missing data is present (or not present?) in most health related datasets, this is a topic that we regularly find ourselves discussing. Working through even the basics on this topics will mean one will also have to work through the challenging and varied (often cryptic) statistical nomenclature.\n“Can we use mixed models, since they use all available data (?)”\nThis brief worked example was motivated by reading this paper that looked to have an interesting worked example that I thought could benefit from some figures."

The data might be Missing At Random, it my be Missing Completely At Random, the important nuances of these are largely out of scope"

To set this up for later in the article, we’ll create a new dataset and use predictions to draw our (straight) line.\n\nnewdat &lt;- expand.grid(t = 1:7, gender = c(\"Male\", \"Female\")) %&gt;% \n  mutate(gender = factor(gender),\n         gender = relevel(gender, \"Male\"),\n         id = c(rep(1, 7), rep(2, 7)))\n\np_mod1 &lt;- cbind(newdat, \n                lwage = predict(mod1, newdat, interval = \"prediction\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOkay, these red fitted lines look like quite a good ‘line of best fit’, they pass the eye test of broadly representing the trends of the data well.\nFitted with a prediction confidence interval, we see.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese lines look parallel - suggestive of no difference in growth rates between the genders (the non-signficant interaction term we saw).\nOf course, we have no adjusted for the within person correlation present in the data. The model above is inappropriate as one of the main assumptions of the model is violated - the data points are not all independent (we know there are 7 from each individual)."

Some extra content on this can be read here or (somewhat less so) here. This use of simulation is part of the reason behind the confidence intervals not being parallel."

    "text": "We are members of the biostatistics team at Telethon Kids Institute in Perth, Western Australia. Our work involves providing statistical consultation and collaboration to child health researchers at all stages of the scientific pipeline, from design to analysis to publication.\n\nPrimarily R users, we encounter particular coding, methodology, or analysis challenges - often that have recurring or related themes. The idea of this site is to be a centralised repository of our solutions to or narration of these recurrent challenges, for both our reference and yours!\nWe hope you’ll find something useful here, and are always open to feedback and conversation on these topics."
