    "text": "As consultant statisticians, we are often approached by people who are already done some preliminary data analysis and who are (now) looking (for assistance) to move onto something more complex; and often, they have done some methodology research. As missing data is present (or not present?) in most health related datasets, this is a topic that we regularly find ourselves discussing. Working through even the basics on this topics will mean one will also have to work through the challenging and varied (often cryptic) statistical nomenclature.\n“Can we use mixed models, they use all available data (?)”\nThis brief worked example was motivated by reading this paper that looked to have an interesting worked example that I thought could benefit from some figures."

The data might be Missing At Random, it my be Missing Completely At Random, the important nuances of these are largely out of scope"

To set this up for later in the article, we’ll create a new dataset and use predictions to draw our (straight) line.\n\nnewdat &lt;- expand.grid(t = 1:7, gender = c(\"Male\", \"Female\")) %&gt;% \n  mutate(gender = factor(gender),\n         gender = relevel(gender, \"Male\"),\n         id = c(rep(1, 7), rep(2, 7)))\n\np_mod1 &lt;- cbind(newdat, \n                lwage = predict(mod1, newdat, interval = \"prediction\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOkay, these red fitted lines look like quite a good ‘line of best fit’, they pass the eye test of broadly representing the trends of the data well.\nFitted with a prediction confidence interval, we see.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese lines look parallel - suggestive of no difference in growth rates between the genders (the non-signficant interaction term we saw).\nOf course, we have no adjusted for the within person correlation present in the data. The model above is inappropriate as one of the main assumptions of the model is violated - the data points are not all independent (we know there are 7 from each individual)."

With linear mixed effects models, we do no have the same function available (that will incorporate the random effects variability in the interval), so rather than calculating these, we simulate! Some extra content on this can be read here or (somewhat less so) here. This use of simulation is part of the reason behind the confidence intervals not being parallel."
