The report can be found here:\n\nhttps://www.thekids.org.au/impactfortourettes \n\nThis report was a summary of results of a national survey undertaken in 2023/2024, and the data analysis and preparation of figures for publication was undertaken by the Biostatistics team at The Kids.\n\nTo support production of the final publication there was considerable behind-the-scenes work, including various challenges common to a large-scale project such as this, wwhere there are many variables and outcomes of interest. For example:\n\n-   Survey coverage of 7 specific impact domains, being comprised of existing validated questionnaires as well as bespoke questions, and including multiple response types (eg multiple choice, radio buttons, free-text fields)\n-   Synthesis of data from 3 different distinct surveys (adults with tics, parents of children with tics, carers of adults with tics) having largely overlapping item/theme content but not necessarily identically matched response choices\\\n-   Only partial survey completion by many respondents\\\n-   Preparation of high-quality PDF output that met the needs of the production team whilst conforming to The Kids style guidelines.\n\nOur experience with the TS collaboration has prompted us to share our approach to tackling larger-scale projects, and any insight it may provide!\n\n# Project design\n\nThe reproducible code-based capabilities of R, readily integrated into a suite of output options via the RStudio environment, have provided the ideal platform to compile a comprehensive document of data summaries, tabulations and graphs from which the authors of the report could draw key results for public dissemination. Furthermore, the theming and formatting features of our in-house `thekidsbiostats` package (https://github.com/The-Kids-Biostats/thekidsbiostats.) are a particularly useful asset for preparation of publication-ready output that conforms to The Kids style guide.\n\nIn line with current practice of our team, features of our general project design include:\n\n-   Overall organisation being that of a self-contained R project with accompanying sub-directories.(See `thekidsbiostats::create_project()` and Figure 2.1 for project template)\n\n    -   Given the scale of the TS project, generation of tables and figures was further blocked into 9 different files corresponding to the distinct survey sections (background information, 7 impact domains, looking to the future). This enabled code and output to be run and checked in manageable chunks before the resulting tables and plots were reunited in an holistic file.\n\n![Directory/subdirectory setup](examples/file_setup.png){#fig-file_setup height=\"4in\"}\n\n*Use of sub-directories in the project organisation is illustrated by @fig-file_setup.*\n\n-   Main output document files are now Quarto documents (with a .qmd extension), superseding the previous default RStudio Markdown (.Rmd) files, having more powerful capabilities but still retaining the same header-text-code structure, simplicity and flexibility. (See  https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html for a useful reference.)\n\nFor those unfamiliar with Quarto, note that .qmd files can be edited and rendered from either a **visual** view or a **source** view within RStudio. The **visual** view aims to give format certain elements (e.g. headers, code chunks, bold/italics) as they will appear in the rendered document. **source** is preferred for more control over each element as the formatting syntax is visible and easily modifiable.  \n\n![Visual screen of the default new QMD file](examples/visual_qmd.png){#fig-visual height=\"4in\" align=\"left\"}\n\n![Source screen of the default new QMD file](examples/source_qmd.png){#fig-source height=\"4in\" align=\"left\"}\n\n![HTML report](examples/defaultQMD-HTML.png){#fig-defaultHTML}\n\n\n\n# Robustness and reproducibility\n\nIt is inevitable that there will be considerable data pre-processing required prior to undertaking any analysis. (This is often the greatest challenge we find with a project.)\n\n::: callout-important\nIt is therefore essential that sound data management practices are maintained.\n:::\n\nWhen pre-processing data:\\\n- **Never** overwrite the raw data\\\n- Always double-check merging of different data sets is accomplished correctly.\\\n- Check consistency of data entry/coding for the same variable sourced from different data sets\\\n- Utilise a data dictionary, and ensure it is noted how missing values are coded\\\n- Ensure newly created data sets are dated\\\n- Scrutinize the final data set for anomalies prior to adopting it for analysis.\n\nFurthermore, one ought to use an appropriate folder/file structure and workflow to ensure that the end product of the data analysis is readable, robust and reproducible. Some of the numerous things that can be used to achieve this are listed below:\n\n-   Utilisation of a project template with organised sub-directories (See `thekidsbiostats::create_project()`)\n\n-   Routine ongoing checks that code as written produces the intended results when executed. (This can partly be automated by packages like `targets` - stay posted for a blog post about that!)\n\n-   Utilisation of user-written functions, with appropriate testing, minimises errors that can creep in when reliant on cut-and-pastes or  manual coding of repeated tasks.\n\n-   Use of a document template for report writing that includes a run date in the header and session info at the end (See `thekidsbiostats::create_template()`, which creates .qmd files such as those seen above)\n\n-   Inherent Quarto document features: Self-containment of the run environment, with other inputs called explicitly; auto-save with each render; text interspersed with result-producing code.\n\n# Streamlining and theming\n\nCoding can be streamlined by adoption of time-saving techniques:\n\n-   Setting of document-wide formatting, execution and style parameters in the document header\n\n    -   For example, extra lines of code in the document YAML headers to facilitate numbering (and referencing) of figure and table captions\n\n    -   Further refinement and definition can be accomplished by utilisation of a .css file (Note the styles.css file created and included in the document header if creating a new document using the Quarto template in `thekidsbiostats` package)\n\n![Example Quarto document header](examples/YAML.png){#fig-YAML}\n\n::: column-margin\nDocument-wide styling can be defined in the Quarto header as in @fig-YAML\n:::\n\n-   Familiarisation with short-cut keys and code (eg see https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/rstudio-shortcuts.html )\n\n-   Judicious use of bespoke functions to reduce repetitive coding eg in generation of tables and plots\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Example code for bespoke function\nsurvey.tblsum<-\n  function(dat,missed=\"no\",var_label=NULL)\n  {\n    if(is.null(var_label))\n      var_label=\"\"\n    SummaryTbl<-dat %>% \n      tbl_summary(by=Survey,\n                  missing=missed) %>%\n      add_overall(last=T) %>%\n      bold_labels() %>%\n      modify_header(label=var_label) %>%\n      modify_footnote(everything()~NA)\n    return(SummaryTbl)\n  }\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nProfessionalism in presentation is enhanced by consistent formatting and theming, which can be embedded into function calls. Note that loading of the `thekidsbiostats` package enabled easy incorporation of Barlow font and the Institute's colour palette as specified in the brand style toolkit.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Construction of the MOVES plot that allows choice of colour scheme \n\nload(\"data/Moves.Rdata\")  # importing the MOVES data summary\n\nkids.cols<-as.vector(thekidsbiostats::thekids_colours)\n# ie kids.cols<-c(\"#F1B434\",\"#F56B00\",\"#00A39C\",\"#00807A\",\"#4A99DE\",\"#426EA8\",\"#1F3B73\")\n\nkids.colsCMYK<-c(\"#FFBA26\" ,\"#FF5C00\" ,\"#00FF7D\", \"#0FC971\",\"#4FA8FF\",\"#3678FF\" ,\"#002EAB\", \"#3F5260\")\nlevs<-unique(moves.dat$type)\n\nmoves.means<-subset(moves.dat,moves.dat$Day==\"Best day\")\nmoves.means2<-subset(moves.dat,moves.dat$Day==\"Worst day\")\nmoves.means$mean2<-moves.means2$mean[match(moves.means$type,moves.means2$type)]\n\n# a function having an argument that defines the colours to be used in the plotting\ndo.moves.plot<-function(my.cols=kids.cols[c(2,4)])\n{\n  ggplot(data=moves.dat,aes(x=mean,y=y,group=Day,colour=Day,fill=Day))+\n  geom_segment(data=moves.means,aes(x=mean,xend=mean2,y=y,yend=y),linewidth=0.5,linetype=2,color=\"grey50\")+  \n  geom_point(aes(shape=Day),size=2.8)+\n  scale_shape_manual(values=c(24,25),guide=guide_legend(nrow=1))+\n  scale_fill_manual(values=my.cols)+\n  scale_color_manual(values=my.cols)+\n  scale_y_continuous(breaks=1:length(levs),labels=levs,minor_breaks=NULL)+\n  scale_x_continuous(limits=c(0,3))+\n  labs(x=\"Mean rating (/3)\",y=\"\",title=\"The MOVES\")+\n  theme_classic(base_family=\"Barlow\",base_line_size=11/30)+\n  theme(\n    plot.title=element_blank(),\n    axis.text.y=element_text(size=rel(1.35),colour=\"black\"),\n    axis.title.x=element_text(size=rel(1)),\n    legend.text=element_text(size=rel(1)),\n    legend.title=element_blank(),\n    panel.grid=element_blank(),\n    legend.position=\"bottom\")\n}\n\n# Construction of a plot to be presented later\nmoves.plot<-do.moves.plot()\nmovesCMYK.plot<-do.moves.plot(my.cols=kids.colsCMYK[c(2,4)])\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n<br>\n\n# Figures for publication\n\nAt the pointy end of the TS project, we were tasked with generating, in a publication-ready format, those figures which the authors had chosen to be included in the final public-facing summary report. This required close consultation with the production team to ensure that the images produced in the PDF files that were requested stayed true to the colour and font formatting as intended. After exploration of several options we settled on the `cairo_pdf`function from the `grDevices` package in the System Library because of its superior consistency and clarity of output.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Code for generating pdf output files of the same R plot \n\n\nlibrary(Cairo) # for CairoPDF\nlibrary(extrafont)  # for embedding Barlow font into the file created by pdf \nloadfonts()   # necessary for embedding Barlow font into the file created by pdf \n\ncairo_pdf(\"examples/diagProf_cairo_pdf.pdf\",family=\"Barlow\",height=3.5,width=9)\nplot.diagProf\ndev.off()\n\nCairoPDF(\"examples/diagProf_CairoPDF.pdf\",family=\"Barlow\",height=3.5,width=9)\nplot.diagProf\ndev.off()\n\npdf(\"examples/diagProf_pdf.pdf\",fonts=\"Barlow\",height=3.5,width=9)\nplot.diagProf\ndev.off()\nembed_fonts(\"examples/diagProf_pdf.pdf\",outfile=\"examples/embedded_diagProf_pdf.pdf\")\n\npdf(\"examples/diagProfCMYK_pdf.pdf\",fonts=\"Barlow\",height=3.5,width=9,colormodel=\"cmyk\")\nCMYK.diagProf\ndev.off()\nembed_fonts(\"examples/diagProfCMYK_pdf.pdf\",outfile=\"examples/embedded_diagProfCMYK_pdf.pdf\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Diagnosing medical professional - HTML `ggplot` output](large_scale_project_files/figure-html/fig-diagProf_html-1.png){#fig-diagProf_html}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n::: column-margin\n**Diagnosing professional**\\\nRegular HTML report output with thekidsbiostats::thekids_theme()\n:::\n\n![Generated by `cairo_pdf`](examples/diagProf_cairo_pdf.png){#fig-diagProf_cairo_pdf}\n\n::: column-margin\n**Diagnosing professional**\\\nThe PDF as generated by cairo_pdf(...,family=\"Barlow\") provides a close likeness to the HTML output of @fig-diagProf_html, and was the preferred format of the production team.\n:::\n\n![Generated by `Cairo::CairoPDF`](examples/diagProf_CairoPDF.png){#fig-diagProf_CairoPDF}\n\n::: column-margin\n**Diagnosing professional**\\\nAs noted by the production team when assessing the alternative outputs, the PDF as generated by `CairoPDF(...,family=\"Barlow)` didn't have such clean lines in its rendering, as can be seen in the discrepancies here, when contrasted with @fig-diagProf_html and @fig-diagProf_cairo_pdf. (Note, also, although retaining `fonts` in its argument list, the help file for `CairoPDF` says `Cairo` ignores this argument as it automatically detects and embeds fonts.)\n:::\n\nGiven a perceived need to also be able to work with a CMYK colour palette to facilitate true-to-colour printing, we further explored use of the `pdf` function (from the system library) to generate PDF figures because of the `colormodel` inclusion in its argument list as an optional parameter:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Diagnosing medical professional - HTML `ggplot` output with CMYK palette](large_scale_project_files/figure-html/fig-cmyk_diagPRac-1.png){#fig-cmyk_diagPRac}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n::: column-margin\n**Diagnosing professional**\\\nRegular HTML report output of a ggplot created using the CMYK palette of the The Kids brand.\n:::\n\n![Generated by `pdf`](examples/diagProfCMYK_pdf.png){#fig-cmyk_diagProf_pdf}\n\n::: column-margin\n**Diagnosing professional**\\\nThis PDF was generated by `pdf(...,fonts=\"Barlow',colormodel=\"cmyk\")` that had as its argument the plot seen in @fig-cmyk_diagProf_pdf.
