Performing almost any operation on these large datasets can take hours to execute -- a real test of patience for exploratory work!\n\nParallel computing is one relatively simple way to reduce computation time on large datasets – leveraging our computer's processing capabilities by simultaneously distributing tasks \"in parallel\" across multiple processors (without too much extra code). This is particularly useful for loop-based computations/simulations, where multiple parameters/conditions must be swept over whether that as part of variable creation/curation, model execution/tuning, or some other task.\n\nThat being said, while parallel computing is not a \"magical general solution\" to all computationally intensive tasks – it is worth investing some time to understand how it works, and become familiar with the packages and/or functions used within a parallel framework. There are still circumstances where the always handy `purrr::map` function, or basic for-loops can be equally or more efficient than initialising parallel computing.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n<p>\n\n# What is Parallel Computing?\n\nParallel computing refers to executing multiple operations in \"parallel\" (i.e. at the same time) across a machine's multiple cores/processors. Most modern computers have at least four cores, and often many more. By default, R uses only one core, running iterative operations sequentially; not starting the next until the previous is complete. However, under a parallel framework, multiple iterations/calculations can be allocated across multiple cores so they can be executed at the same time, thus saving time.\n\nIn this post, we will have a look at a couple of examples using `R`. We provide some simple examples and use-cases, in addition to some further resources if you would like to learn more.\n\nThe [`doParallel`](#0) and [`foreach`](#0) packages of `R` are one set of packages, intended to be used together, to facilitate a syntactically simple parallel computing environment in `R` – by use of the `%dopar%` operator. Additionally the base `parallel` package is used for some basic set-up and detection.\n\nThese examples are run using R version 4.3.3 (2024-02-29) on Darwin 23.4.0.\n\n<br>\n\n## Setup\n\n-   Let's check the number of cores available on our machine.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nparallel::detectCores()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 8\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n<p>\n\n-   We should not allocate all of our machine's available cores to parallel computations – this will consume all of the available resources!\n-   Let's use 6 cores for our examples.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndoParallel::registerDoParallel(6)\n```\n:::\n\n\n-   Below is a screenshot from the Windows task manager.

This allows us to estimate the sampling distribution for a statistic (mean, variance, etc.) and assess its stability/reliability, without making strong assumptions about the underlying population. This can be useful when the data are problematic in some fundamental way (small sample sizes, insufficient variation, violation of model assumptions).\n\nIn `R`, for-loops can be used to derive a set of bootstrap samples. As we will see, parallel environments can much more efficiently handle operations like these of a repeated nature.\n\n-   Let's use the `mtcars` data set to run a basic linear regression.\n    -   We would like to explore the association between a vehicle's fuel efficiency (`mpg`) and horsepower (`hp`), weight (`wt`) and transmission type (automatic/manual, `am`).\n-   We suspect some of the assumptions of standard linear regression may be violated (normality of errors) because of the small sample size. By bootstrapping, we can explore the stability of the regression coefficients by calculating a confidence interval about the bootstrapped coefficient estimates.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Let's set up the data and number of bootstrap samples\ndata(mtcars)\nmtcars <- as_tibble(mtcars)\n\nhead(mtcars)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 6 × 11\n    mpg   cyl  disp    hp  drat    wt  qsec    vs    am  gear  carb\n  <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl>\n1  21       6   160   110  3.9   2.62  16.5     0     1     4     4\n2  21       6   160   110  3.9   2.88  17.0     0     1     4     4\n3  22.8     4   108    93  3.85  2.32  18.6     1     1     4     1\n4  21.4     6   258   110  3.08  3.22  19.4     1     0     3     1\n5  18.7     8   360   175  3.15  3.44  17.0     0     0     3     2\n6  18.1     6   225   105  2.76  3.46  20.2     1     0     3     1\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n<p>\n\n-   Let's set the number of bootstrap trials.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntrials <- 10000 # Number of bootstrap samples\n```\n:::\n\n\n<p>\n\n## For-loop\n\n-   Let's begin by using the \"tried and true\" for-loop.
